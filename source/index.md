## Welcome to the IntelliJ Platform SDK Documentation!

Here you can find [basic information](basics.md) about the *IntelliJ Platform SDK*, in particular how to **[get started](basics/getting_started.md)** with developing plugins for IntelliJ IDEA and other IDEs.

More details about specific development topics can be found in the [Architecture Reference Guide](reference_guide.md). 

A set of **[step-by-step tutorials](tutorials.md)** with code samples will lead you through the common use cases for the *IntelliJ Platform SDK*.

The [Plugin Development FAQ](faq.md) section contains a series of issues commonly discussed on our [Open API and Plugin Development](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/200366979-IntelliJ-IDEA-Open-API-and-Plugin-Development) forums.

One of the ways to improve the *IntelliJ SDK* documentation is to **[contribute to the project](CONTRIBUTING.md)**. Any kind of content including tutorials, articles about architecture or code samples that can help plugin developers is kindly welcome. Please read the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to share your knowledge.

Please let us know about any **content inconsistencies**, outdated materials, cosmetic issues, or other defects you may find by submitting an issue to [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/IJSDK). If you haven't found a documentation topic that answers your questions, feel free to file a **[request](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=IJSDK)**.
